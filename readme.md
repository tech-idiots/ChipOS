# ChipOS

ChipOS is a desktop operating system **simulator** written in Python.  
It was created by a developer with a simple dream: **to make an OS**.

While ChipOS is not a real kernel or low-level operating system, it simulates
the look, feel, and behavior of a desktop environment — including windows,
dragging, theming, and custom UI logic — all built using Python and Pygame.
